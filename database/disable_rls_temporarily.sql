-- Temporarily disable RLS on user_profiles table for easier profile creation
-- This will be re-enabled later when the authentication flow is stable

-- Disable RLS on user_profiles table
ALTER TABLE public.user_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing RLS policies (they won't work when RLS is disabled anyway)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON public.user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON public.user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON public.user_profiles;

-- Grant full access to authenticated users (temporary)
GRANT ALL ON public.user_profiles TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON public.user_profiles TO anon;

-- Note: This is a temporary solution to fix profile creation issues
-- RLS will be re-enabled later with proper policies
