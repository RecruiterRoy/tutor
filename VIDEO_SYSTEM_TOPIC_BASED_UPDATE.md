# Video System Topic-Based Update

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Removed Class Dependency from Video Selection

**Problem**: Videos were previously filtered by class level, limiting their availability to specific grade levels.

**Solution**: Modified the video selection system to prioritize topic-based search over class-based search.

### 2. New Video Selection Priority Order

1. **Topic-based search**: `getVideosBySubjectAndTopic(subject, topic)` - Finds videos by subject and specific topic
2. **Subject-only search**: `getVideosBySubject(subject)` - Falls back to all videos for a subject
3. **Class-based fallback**: `getVideosBySubjectAndClass(subject, classLevel)` - Kept for backward compatibility

### 3. New Functions Added

#### In `pages/api/supabase-video-database.js`:
- `getVideoDateStats()` - Gets video posting date statistics
- `getVideosBySubjectAndTopic(subject, topic)` - Topic-based video search
- `getVideosBySubject(subject)` - Subject-only video search

#### In `pages/api/video-date-stats.js`:
- New API endpoint to get video date statistics

#### In `pages/api/manage-video-database.js`:
- Added support for topic-based search actions
- `get_videos_by_topic` action
- `get_videos_by_subject_only` action

### 4. Modified Files

1. **`pages/api/enhanced-chat.js`**:
   - Updated video selection logic to use topic-based search first
   - Removed class dependency from primary search
   - Added fallback hierarchy

2. **`pages/api/supabase-video-database.js`**:
   - Added new search functions
   - Added date statistics function

3. **`pages/api/manage-video-database.js`**:
   - Added new API actions for topic-based search

### 5. YouTube Video Upload Date Information

The system now fetches actual YouTube upload dates using the YouTube Data API:

**YouTube Data Retrieved**:
- `publishedAt` - When video was originally uploaded to YouTube
- Video title and channel information
- Actual upload timeline from YouTube

**Date Statistics Available**:
- Total videos by month/year of YouTube upload
- YouTube upload date breakdown
- Summary of when videos were posted to YouTube
- Sample video details with exact upload dates

**Fallback**: If YouTube API is unavailable, falls back to database dates

### 6. Benefits

1. **Better Video Sharing**: Same videos can now be shown to students of different classes
2. **Improved Relevance**: Topic-based search finds more relevant content
3. **Flexible Learning**: Students can access videos appropriate to their learning level regardless of class
4. **YouTube Upload Date Tracking**: Can see when videos were originally posted to YouTube

### 7. Testing

Use the test script `test-video-date-stats.js` to:
- Check YouTube video upload date statistics
- Test topic-based video search
- Verify the new functionality

### 8. API Endpoints

**New Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/video-date-stats` - Get YouTube video upload date statistics
- `GET /api/manage-video-database?action=get_videos_by_topic&subject=X&topic=Y`
- `GET /api/manage-video-database?action=get_videos_by_subject_only&subject=X`

**Example Usage**:
```bash
# Get YouTube video upload date stats
curl http://localhost:3000/api/video-date-stats

# Search videos by topic
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/manage-video-database?action=get_videos_by_topic&subject=mathematics&topic=addition"

# Get all videos for a subject
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/manage-video-database?action=get_videos_by_subject_only&subject=science"
```

### 9. Backward Compatibility

- Class-based search is still available as a fallback
- Existing API endpoints continue to work
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

This update makes the video system more flexible and allows for better content sharing across different student levels while maintaining all existing functionality.
